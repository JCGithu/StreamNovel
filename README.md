# Twitch Novel

A book written by a Twitch stream, god help us all.

This is part of NANOWRIMO (Write a Novel in A Month) and being written over at [ColloquialOwl on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/colloquialowl).

We need to hit 50,000 words by December. Good luck.

## __The Novel__

__Genre:__ Fantasy

>Aeliana has woken up with no memory. Good thing a great evil isn't spreading over the land. Oh wait...

## __Contributing__
You can contribute to any aspect of the project. The novel will be entirely witten by people submitting to the github, from the structure to the prose itself.

To add to a chapter simply choose one, check it's outline, and then add to the prose document.

If you just want to add a name suggestion for a character, place, or the book itself please add to the documents in the Names folder.

## __Rules__
* Just be ethical
* No offensive names / slang / racial terms
* #hugsallowed

### Notes
> * Don't be afraid to write something generic/cringy. It's a changing document and every word takes us closer to that 50,000 word goal.
> * Please try to use character names and places from the suggested name documents so that people can contribute at any level.
