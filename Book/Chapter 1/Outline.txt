// Aeliana wakes up in a strange place with no memory.

As Aeliana, a young girl who looks exactly like GreatGameGal, (go watch her stream at TWITCH_LINK) wakes up and looks around her environment. She finds herself in a park in the middle of a bright sunny day with no recollection of how she got there. It begins to dawn on her her lack of memory spans beyond that, she doesn't even remember who she is beyond her name.
